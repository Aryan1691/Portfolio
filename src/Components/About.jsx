            Iâ€™m Aryan Khatik, a skilled web development professional with
            expertise in responsive user interfaces, bug resolution, and project
            management. I played a key role in developing **"Brocus"**,
            showcasing both technical and leadership abilities. While with
            Madtech Solutions, I was assigned to **St. Lawrence School** for two
            months to teach HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, guide students in
            creating basic web projects, and enhance the school's web
            application. Later, at **Programming.com**, I contributed to the
            **Recruitment.AI** project by managing issues, designing technical
            training sessions, and fostering a collaborative environment. I hold
            certifications in **Full Stack Development** and **Advanced
            JavaScript** from Upgrad, and **Responsive Web Design** from
            FreeCodeCamp, strengthening my expertise in building robust web
            applications.
